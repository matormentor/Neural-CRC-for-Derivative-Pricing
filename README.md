This project aims to recreate and enhance the results of the CRC paper from Mateo Gambara and Josef Teichmann that uses an **Autoencoder** like Neural Network architechture to create an inverse map from an Implied Volaitlity Surface (IVS) to the necessary dynamic parameters that arose this term structure
